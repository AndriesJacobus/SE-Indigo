\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification Document is to lay out the findings of a standardised requirements elicitation for the proposed application. In doing this, both the capabilities that the application is expected to deliver together, with the constraints on the solution space are described.\newline \newline The document will take into account requirements, as set out by both the developers and the prospective users, in order to lay a foundation for the up-coming phases of the Software Development Cycle. The various sections each provide details on specific types of requirements of the application.\newline \newline The intended audience include developers/peers(Team Indigo and other COS 301 teams), domain experts(COS 301 Lectures and the University of Pretoria Management), customers/end-users(students, staff and visitors at the University of Pretoria) who will perform a technical, expert  and customer review of this document respectively.
 
\subsection{Scope}
The name of the proposed software application is NavUP (NavigationUP). NavUP is intended to be an information service application that is to provide navigational information to visitors, employees and students of the University of Pretoria. This includes usual navigational functions (mapping and routing of campus), surveillance, user based information delivery and event calenders. NavUP will not extend its functionalities outside the Hatfield Campus and the University of Pretoria will not take any responsibility for any injury, damage or whatsoever that may be a result of the application. The application is used at your own risk.\newline \newline The objectives of the product include making the University of Pretoria feel more "like home" to all stakeholders alike. The application aims to facilitate a wide range of users who have had difficulties in the past with regard travelling within the premises. Ease of travel, accessibility of the various facilities, time optimisations, event/day-to-day coordination's, alleviating pedestrian traffic congestion problems, description of activities etc. are the joint objectives of the project.\newline \newline The goal is to integrate existing applications within the university like the Wi-Fi hotspots, IT-Services, Official University Website, Social Media and more.  Another goal is for the application to make use of human resources for its development and usage i.e. expertise from the COS 301, Honours groups of students and lectures to satisfy the former and make use of crowd-sourcing principles (using smart devices) to serve the latter. \newline \newline The benefits include smoothness of the day-to-day operations at the University which leads to greater productivity and efficiency among students and staff alike. It allows the university to increase its brand value in terms of the facilities it provides to keep external stakeholders pleased. National and Global Rankings of the university are bound to rise and consequently attract a larger group of people in the long run.

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
%\let\labelitemi\labelitemii
The factors that affect the requirements are:
\begin{itemize}
	 
		\item Lack of connectivity -  Wi-Fi isn't available everywhere on campus (e.g. I.T building). Thus, assuming that Wi-Fi on campus will essentially be available everywhere in due time, and/or mobile network fall-back is assumed.
		
		\item Mobile devices - It is assumed that a user will have a mobile device that can run the application; it must specifically be able to run the newer versions of Android, IOS and Windows Mobile. We assumed that the mobile device was powerful enough to draw maps and emulate navigation.
		\item Server - The application depends on running on a remote server where the mobile application can authenticate and gain essential information to navigation.
		
		\item Hotspots - We assumed that the Wi-Fi Hotspots on campus will be forever lasting and we depend on this application to triangulate and refine navigation on the application.
	 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

%\let\labelitemi\labelitemii

\noindent \\ Real-Time Processing

\begin{itemize}
\item Map Search Algorithm\\The search algorithm should be efficient – keywords specified by the user needs to be hashed to find the location on the map. A time-complexity of Big-O(1) is achieved. A hash-table with possible keywords need to be matched to locations on the map.

\item Directional Search Algorithm\\The routes determined must be least cost routes in terms of distance and in terms of traffic rates – Djikstra’s algorithm.

\item User Location Determination\\The coordination of the Wi-Fi hotspots in determining user location should be to a precision that allows an error-rate of no more than 7 metres.

\item Re-Routing\\A time-elapse of no more than 5 seconds is allowed when the system has to re-calculate the routes.

\item Capacity\\The system must have the ability to handle requests from a minimum of 1000 users. Around 10000 requests can be made to the user on average in a day.

\item Interactiveness and Response Time\\The system must be interactive and the delays involved must be less. The opening of tabs, pop-ups, dialog boxes, switching between traffic and terrestrial maps, scrolling up and across the scene and zooming in and out of the map should all have quick response time - these functions need to be initiated within two seconds submitting them to the system in the form of click/scroll input.

\item System Dependability\\If the system loses the connection to the Wi-Fi or gets some gibberish input to which it transitions to an unstable state, the user should be informed rather then there being stagnant instances of time.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Constraints}
\paragraph{...}

 
\subsection{Software System Attributes}
\subsubsection{Quality Requirements }
The following section will focus on the quality requirements of the overall system and mobile application at its highest level of granularity. All the requirements defined, are for all components of the system.

\paragraph{\textbf{Reliability}\\}
The system and application should be reliable in the fact that the user should be able to reach his/her destination and that the information provided by the system and application is accurate and authentic. The system should always be on-line and provide the expected functionality without errors or discrepancies. The system should also provide additional information aiding the reliability by giving a short description or history of the building or venue to make it more reliable and accurate. 

\paragraph{\textbf{Security}\\}
Although security is not a key feature, the system should protect any personal information by hashing passwords with a secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 and not leak any information from the system or application. The application should have access to the users Wi-Fi connections as well as cellular fall-back for enhanced navigation and even GPS. The system or application should not store any Wi-Fi information from the device or pull user-names and passwords from the users device and leak it.
We will achieve security by making use of 3 methods, namely: prevention, detection, and recovery. We will ensure that we have put means in
place through which we may be able to detect any threats to the system,
for example, validating any information that is required to be sent to the
server. Preventing threats to the system can be enforced through limiting the access channels, making use of authentication, not allowing any
external sources to be accessed through the system, etc. Recovery will be
achieved through cancelling requests and maintaining a working back up
state to roll back changes.  

\paragraph{\textbf{Availability} \\}
 The system should be available at all times and the mobile application available to most recent types of user devices and operating systems on these devices. The system should always be on-line except if there is no Wi-Fi connectivity.

\paragraph{\textbf{Flexibility} \\}
 An important element of the system is its flexibility. 
 Each component of the system should be decoupled from every other component, thus allowing you to change certain components without affecting anything else. 
 For example, it should be easy to add a new Lecture Venue to the system with little or no code modifications. 
 The main focus of the software is to allow the user to easily navigate to his/her destination with minimal effort.
 In spite of this, the navigation route should be flexible in the sense there could be many different routes that the user can take and the system should be able to redirect or find another or even the best route that is in the users radius.

\paragraph{\textbf{Maintainability} \\}
 The system needs to be maintainable so that the future prospects of this system can expand to other campuses and in doing so code should be modular and well documented. Software and frameworks to be used should have a wide range of support and be established aiding the maintainability of the system.

\paragraph{\textbf{Scalability} \\}
 The system should be able to process data fast and data should not be lost so there should be a bus architecture to solve the data loss problem. The system should be able to allow for multiple users connecting to the service and be able to handle large volumes of users with no performance loss. The system should be coded to be scalable so that it can be deployed on many platforms such as Android, IOS and Microsoft Windows Mobile with compatibility support. The application should also be scalable so that it can easily change from a 2D navigation system to a 3D or even augmented reality for the ultimate user experience.

\paragraph{\textbf{Auditability} \\}
 The system and application should make use of logs so that if there are any queries or faults it can easily be traced or detected. These logs will also log navigational information, and for future prospects a user can opt in to share their experience where these log files from the application could be sent to a remote server where the developers can analyse this data to improve the system. \\The following is necessary to be logged:
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Program crashes
 	\item Navigation route (source and destination and some meta data [e.g. Time taken, estimated distance, etc.])
 \end{itemize}
 

\paragraph{\textbf{Usability} \\}
 The mobile application should be easy to use and adhere to UI/UX standards with regards to the layout and user interfaces for interaction. The application should have easy navigation between functionality and views, as well as a intuitive way to display or simulate the user navigating to his/her destination on the map.
 
 
\paragraph{\textbf{Performance} \\}
The performance of a system refers to the behaviour of the system in
terms of response time and throughput. Changes and modifications to
the system should be done in the most cost and time effective manner to
provide a good user experience. One method of ensuring the performance
is visible to the user is to make use of feedback tools to ensure the user
is aware that the system is performing as expected or to notify the users
should something have gone wrong.
